Project Overview
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, analysis, and training of a simple linear regression model on a dataset.
The dataset contains information about employees, including their names, ages, salaries, and departments.
The program processes this data by filling missing values, calculating mean values by department, encoding categorical data,
and training a machine learning model to predict salaries based on other features.

Features
Fill Missing Values: Missing values in numeric columns (e.g., Age, Salary) are filled with the mean of the respective columns.
Grouping by Department: The dataset is grouped by the Department column, and the mean of numeric columns is calculated for each department.
Encoding Categorical Data: Categorical data in columns like Department and Name is encoded into numeric values.
Model Training: A linear regression model is trained to predict salary based on other numeric columns in the dataset,
and the model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Example Output
The script will output the following steps:

Original Data: Display the input data with missing values and categorical columns.
Filling Missing Values: It will fill the missing values with the mean of the respective columns.
Grouping by Department: It will group the data by the Department column and calculate the mean of numeric columns for each department.
Encoding Categorical Data: It will encode categorical columns into numeric values.
Model Training: It will train a linear regression model and print the modelâ€™s Mean Squared Error (MSE).
